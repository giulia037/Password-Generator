# Password-Generator

For this activity I used the Html and CSS from our mini project we covered in class. Then with the javascript I started by writing down the questions that were in our criteria. That is also how I found my variable names. I considered making a variable for the numbers special characters ect but I found an easier way to display the info I wanted. Which as you can see I just put all of that info into one variable and made else if statements to collect only data I needed based on what the user entered.
